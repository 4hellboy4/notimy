## Overview
This app provides people with convinience. A person can use it without signing up, namely without exposing personal information such as mobile phone, emai, etc. If you have to provide someone with a one-time service and do not want to share your personal data, you merely show your identifier, you or another person are sent with an invitation to create a channel and that is it. When the serviсe is provided, push the button on the certain channel to finish it and notify another user you are connected with.
