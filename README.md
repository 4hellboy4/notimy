## Overview
This app provides people with convinience. A person can use it without signing up, namely without exposing personal information such as phone number, emai, etc. If you have to provide someone with a one-time service and do not want to share your personal data, you merely show your identifier, you or another person are sent with an invitation to create a channel and that is it. When the serviсe is provided, push the button on the certain channel to finish it and notify another user you are connected with.

## Comparison Table
To conclude that our app is in demand we made a comparison table with existing alternatives and showed pros and cons of each solution.

| Characteristics | Restaurant Pagers | Messaging apps | Waiting table | Notimy |

The comparison table demonsttraits that the app's creation is advisable


## Example of Use
Imagine you rip your trousers and to stich the hole you decide to give it to sewing workshop. They ask your phone number, but you decline sharing it, because you are concerned about privacy and do not want to get spam day-to-day. They say it will not be a problem, make a deal and ask you to come back back within two hours. After time runs out you come back and nothing changes, trousers are still ripped. You realise that you wasted time. That is the moment when one-time anonymous channels gets handy. Both you and sewing workshop have Notimy, create a channel and when the tast is complited you will get a notification. You saved your time and still do not expose personal data

## Future Plans
The main goal for the nearest future is to create the web virsion of the application, because often people are lazy, they do not want to download anything. To simplify it, I intend to create a website and moreover make possible to create channels by scanning the QR code.
